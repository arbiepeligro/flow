##**Possibilities for Flow:**

Future Integration with Smart TVs and Devices
Flow could soon become available on platforms like Android TV, Roku, or other smart home devices — bringing live streaming directly to living rooms with seamless navigation.

##**Offline Viewing Features**

While currently focused on live streaming, there may be plans to introduce offline viewing or a catch-up feature for selected channels and programs.

##**Cross-Platform User Sync**

A user account system may be introduced, allowing viewers to save favorites and preferences across devices — from mobile phones to tablets and TVs.

##**Original Programming and Content**

The platform could expand into exclusive or original content, such as local shows, indie films, or community-produced segments that highlight Filipino culture and talent.

##**Community-Driven Development**

**Flow** may be building a user feedback loop — like a private group or beta access program — where active users can shape new features and test updates before public release.
